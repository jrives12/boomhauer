## Environment Setup (Students)

1.) Install Java JDK 17+. JDK located [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html). If you have a Mac you can use `brew`.

```bash
brew install --cask corretto@17
```

If you're on Windows, download the `.msi` installer from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html) and run.

2.) Create your personal repository from Github. You should receive a unique link from your professor from Github Classroom that will generate a private repository within your Github account.
It should look something like this.

```bash
https://classroom.github.com/a/{classroomId}
```

3.) This will create your personal repository within the [Citadel CS Github Organization](https://github.com/CitadelCS).

4.) Clone down the repository from Github

```bash
git clone git@git.github.com:CitadelCS/csci-602-fall-2021-{yourUsername}.git
```

5.) Build the project 

> Disclaimer: If running on a Windows machine replace `./mvnw` with `.\mvnw`

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

You should see a success if everything is set up correctly.

6.) Run the API

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Access the API by visiting [http://localhost:5001/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:5001/swagger-ui/index.html). From there you can hit the endpoints directly.

7.) Success!
