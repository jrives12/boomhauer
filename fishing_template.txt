Fishing Recommendation Report
=============================

Location: Lake Pleasant
Date Range Analyzed: 2025-11-18

Best Times to Fish:
 • 6:00 AM – 9:30 AM  
   Reason: Light wind (5–8 mph), stable barometric pressure, surface water temperature at 64°F, and moderate bass activity during early-morning low-light periods.

 • 5:15 PM – 7:00 PM  
   Reason: Evening cooling aligns water temperature with the preferred feeding range for trout (58–65°F). Currents slow to < 1.5 ft/s which increases surface strike likelihood.

Air Temperature: 55°F (morning), 62°F (evening)
Water Temperature: 64–66°F
Recommended Fish Species: Bass, Trout

Environmental Notes:
 - Wind: 5–10 mph from the NW  
 - Barometric Pressure: Stable at ~30.12 inHg  
 - Currents: 2.1–2.5 ft/s in open channel; calmer near reeds  
 - Weather: Clear skies, no precipitation  
 - Tides: N/A (lake body)  

Overall Fishing Conditions Rating: 8.4 / 10

Location: River Bend
Date Range Analyzed: 2025-11-18

Best Times to Fish:
 • 7:15 AM – 10:00 AM  
   Reason: Increasing water movement triggers higher catfish feeding activity. Slight cloud cover reduces surface reflection and improves bait visibility near the bank.

 • 8:00 PM – 10:30 PM  
   Reason: Optimal for channel catfish; water temperature drops to 59°F which aligns with their preferred nocturnal feeding window. Slight NE current (< 1.2 ft/s) improves scent-based lure spread.

Air Temperature: 60–68°F
Water Temperature: 59–62°F
Recommended Fish Species: Catfish

Environmental Notes:
 - Wind: 3–7 mph from the NE  
 - Barometric Pressure: Slight upward trend (30.05 → 30.11 inHg) improves fish predictability  
 - Currents: 1.0–1.3 ft/s, stable  
 - Weather: Partly cloudy, low humidity  
 - Tides: High tide at 7:00 AM, low tide at 1:15 PM  

Overall Fishing Conditions Rating: 7.9 / 10
